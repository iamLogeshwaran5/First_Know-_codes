# Armstrong Number

## Definition

An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number or plenary number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Example

Let's consider the number 153:

1. The number of digits in 153 is 3.
2. Each digit raised to the power of the number of digits (which is 3 in this case) is:
   - \(1^3 = 1\)
   - \(5^3 = 125\)
   - \(3^3 = 27\)
3. The sum of these values is \(1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).
4. Since the sum of the cubes of its digits equals the number itself, 153 is an Armstrong number.

## General Formula

For an n-digit number \(abc...z\):
\[a^n + b^n + c^n + ... + z^n = \text{the number itself}\]

## Properties

- Armstrong numbers are rare.
- These numbers are named after Michael F. Armstrong.
- Armstrong numbers exist in a few number bases (e.g., decimal, binary, etc.).

## Usage

Armstrong numbers can be used in various programming puzzles and mathematical applications to test understanding of loops, arithmetic operations, and number manipulation.
